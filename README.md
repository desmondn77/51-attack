#Vulnerability to 51% attacks
To prevent 51% attacks, there is a need to understand some things. In a general classification, the key factors for the survival of blockchain networks include the following:
- Blockchain Technology
- Social Engineering
- Blockchain Management
In a blockchain network, if any of these things suffer from defects, it can lead to the vulnerability of that network against 51% attacks. Of course, in most cases, the presence of defects in all factors provides a suitable situation for an attack.
In this notebook, the degree of vulnerability of blockchain networks has been examined. By presenting the regression model, the probability of being attacked by a blockchain network is checked.
However, our study has flaws in this modeling that will definitely affect its results:
- Low number of data (The number of attacks is small)
- There is not enough information in this field
- This is a suggested model, not an optimal model
